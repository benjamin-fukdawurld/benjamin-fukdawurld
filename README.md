# Hi devs! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ben, a former mechanic, and a 10+ years developper.

## I'm currently working on Typescript/Javascript full stack projects.

I have done __7+ years of C++__ in different companies (_SAP, Continental, Faurecia, Devialet..._), working on financial apps, embedded systems, web services backend, AI, Computer vision etc. All these projects were amazingly challenging but I've learned C++ because I wanted to code __Games__ ðŸ˜„, therefore I've eaten tons of OpenGL code, but I need to pay my bills and we all know game programming is paid with __passion__ not cash... ðŸ˜…

I Started a Game engine a few years ago and I reboot it everytime I get back to it but I will finish it one day.then(() => reboot()).catch(() => reboot())

I love this project but it is really time consuming and I sometimes feel like C++ is in a long agony...
Not really the language, but the reason to pick it for new devs tends to reduce more and more every year.

> C++ and me decided to have a break, he was sad, I was not.

I'm passionated and curious on programing and learning new stuffs.
That leads me to learn everyday and play around with a lot of code and tech. My current plan is to master, _full stack Js/Ts_ development and get a deeper dive into _Devops_, _Cloud_ and why not _Go_.
