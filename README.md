### Hi devs! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ben, a former mechanic, and a 10+ years deveopper.

I'm currently working on Typescript/Javascript full stack projects.

I have done 7+ years of C++ in different companies (SAP, Continental, Faurecia, Devialet...), working on financial apps, embedded systems, web services backend, AI, Computer vision etc. All these projects were amazingly challenging but I've learned C++ because I wanted to code GAMES ðŸ˜„, therefore I've eaten tons of OpenGL code, but I need to pay my bills and we all know game programming is paid with __passion__ not cash... ðŸ˜…

I Started a Game engine a few years ago and I reboot it everytime I get back to it but I will finish it one day.then(() => reboot()).catch(() => reboot())

I love this project but it is really time consuming 

C++ and me decided to have a break, he was sad I was not.
